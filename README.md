# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
The objective of this assignment was to analyze the data from different city types that contained information about ride shares to allow PyBer to develop a business model for their new company.  The data that was needed was an overal summary per city type (Urban, Suburban, and Rural) that would show the total fares and percentage per driver and rider.  We would also gather info on the total rides and total drivers.  Then information was specified on a weekly bases and a multiple line graph displaying the total fares by week per city type.

## Results
After gathering and analyzing the data we started with a general summary of the total fares, drivers and riders for the three city types.  From this information average fare per ride and the average fare per driver was determined.  As seen in the image below.  Based on the data the larger totals of rides, drivers, and fares were in urban cities with suburban cities being next and rural areas coming in last.  The data also shows an inverse in the average fare per ride and per driver with the larger amounts in rural areas and then suburban, with urban coming in last.

This information was broken down on a weekly bases for a specific date range from Jan. 1 - Apr. 28 of 2019 as shown in the datafram and multiple line graphs below. This shows that the total fares per week for the three listed data types.  It shows the higher fares in the urban areas, then the suburban areas, with the lowest fare amounts in the rural areas.

## Summary
In conclusion there are three recommendations that can be made from a business standpoint.  The first one would be to focus your availability primarily in the urban and then suburban areas since the majority of the money is being spent in these areas.  The second recommendation would be to set price points lower than but still comparable to the amounts that have been displayed in the provided charges.  The final suggestion would be to make sure that that there are plenty of availability of drivers in the months that have the higher rates since those would be the months that have the highest demand for your services.
